# KoolBot
This is a pretty simple discord bot I made to use with my friends in our discord server.
I used Discordjs to handle pretty much everything, DotEnv to handle key's encryption

# API Request
I implemented the possibility to make API requests to the https://tenor.com/ API by using axios and node-fetch.
This is one of the first times I use an API for a project and it was really fun and interesting

# Add Kool bot to your discord server
The functionality of this bot is pretty simple, but feel free to add it to your server :3
